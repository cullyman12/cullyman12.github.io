<p><br>With today being Monday, and with final exams for spring courses this week, I know I could use some extra motivation/inspiration. For anyone else needing a little push, here are a few links that are certain to do the trick.</p><br><br>

<h2> <strong><em>Wanderers</em></strong></h2>
<h3> A short film by erik wernquist</h3><br>

<p>This four-minute short film by Erik Wernquist, narrated by some old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan" target="_blank">Carl Sagan </a> recordings, is certain to give you chills. The film features some mind-blowing CGI, depicting human expansion out into new worlds, as well as an equally mind-blowing score and some riveting quotes from Dr. Sagan, regarding human existence and our inherent craving for exploration. My favourite quote, "I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote, I love to sail forbidden seas", from Herman Melville's <em>Moby Dick.</em></p>

<p>If this film does not inspire you, I'm almost certain that nothing will...</p><br>

<h2> <strong><em>Make It Count</em></strong></h2>
<h3> A Nike ad by Casey Neistat</h3><br>

<p>A few weeks ago, my brother told me about a New York-based film director/producer named Casey Neistat. The guy is entertaining, creative, and super ambitious. He's inspired <em>himself</em> by tattooing the phrases "work harder" and "do more" on his arms, in almost disturbingly simple fonts. Hopefully he can inspire you too! </p><br>

<h2> <strong><em>Dream</em></strong></h2>
<h3> A motivational video by Mateusz M</h3><br>

<p>Perhaps you're one of the 21 million people, who have already watched this video. If you are, watch it again. Maybe I'm just seduced by awesome music tracks, but I don't think that's the case. Every time I listen to this, I feel like I'm ready to run through walls.</p><br>
