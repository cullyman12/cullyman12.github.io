 My very first blog post, featuring an introductory video and a cheesy story about the power of a small compliment.

 A few months back, I was walking down Spring Garden Road in Halifax, when I saw someone wearing a nice pair of boots. I thought to myself, “Hm, I like those boots”, so I told him, “I like those boots”. He was a bit startled when I said it, and I asked him where he had bought them. He told me that he’d bought them in Korea. After asking a few more questions, I learned that he was from South Korea, and or meet any friends.  Without really thinking about it, I just asked “want a friend?”. 

 Though he seemed a little surprised, Ho-Jin was happy to take my number and I asked him to text me when he wanted to meet up. 

 Since then Ho-Jin and I have become great friends. He just finished up at the ECSL School on Barrington St. in Halifax, and I will now be acting as Ho-Jin’s English tutor. Had I kept the small compliment to myself, we never would have met, and both would have missed out on a great friendship and learning experience. 

 If you have something nice to say, SAY IT! <br   /> <br   />

 Speaking of which, this blog was inspired by someone a lot smarter and cooler than myself! Her name is Mel Hattie, and you can check out her work at [MelHattie.com](http://www.melhattie.com/).
