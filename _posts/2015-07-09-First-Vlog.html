<p>I've wanted to try vlogging for a few weeks now and kept running into setbacks, but I finally got one done! Check it out!</p><br>

<p>First thing is first, holy s*** I underestimated how much work this takes. I had to edit about 250 individual clips, and had the genius idea to try a new editing software for the first time. I also completely ran out of space on my mac (even after deleting everything I could possibly spare), so I had to borrow an 
external hard drive before I could finish.</p><br>

<p>My parents are also going to hate me for walking along the edge of the bridge again, but I swear it's not as sketchy as it looks!</p><br>

<p>For my very first vlog, I'm pleased with the result. I definitely learned a lot in the process, and I now know not to record 400 clips... I also now know what the sound quality is like on the first gen go pro, and I know how user friendly Adobe Premiere Pro is <strong><em>NOT</em></strong>. I also know that I need to do a better job of telling a story as I go, instead of just slapping random clips together. For example, when Nico and I went to the library I didn't really explain what we were doing. For anyone wondering, we were working on the matchup schedule for this week's Lawn Summer Nights. Week 2 spectator tickets have already sold out, so stay tuned for week 3 tickets!</p><br>

<p>Not sure how often I will be vlogging, as it requires a totally different skill set and work load than just writing blog material. I definitely think it's a cool concept and will be making some more for sure.</p><br>

<p>  Feedback is very much appreciated, so please send me a message on facebook or leave comments on the youtube video, if you have any thoughts or ideas for me!</p>
