<p>It's been ten days since my last post. Between a mix of spring courses at SMU, work, and some general anxiety, I'd found myself in a bit of a rut the past few days. Having recognized that I was slipping, I tried waking up at 5am, in an attempt to get ahead and lay out my week, but found myself distracted and unable to give my full attention to any one of my competing priorities.<br><br>I know it sounds clich√©, but I figured some time outside with friends might be all I needed to get myself back on track.</p><br>

<p>After a quick trip out to the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=duncan%27s+cove&espv=2&biw=1680&bih=843&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=g3JjVcO7NOPLsASPyICwBQ&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg&dpr=2" target="_blank">Duncan's Cove Nature Reserve</a>(photos below), I found myself both mentally and physically refreshed. We followed up the hike with an awesome BBQ, and we were even given free burgers at Sobeys! Yeah, and then I got food poisoning... </p><br><br>

<h6>Nothing like waking up wearing a hoodie and sweatpants, covered in cold sweat, dehydrated, and confused all at the same time! And yes, that is me in that photo.</h6><br>

<p>I'm feeling better now, and with improving weather and spring courses coming to an end soon enough, I am super excited to start checking off some of my summer to-do's.</p><br>

<p>I had a very proud moment earlier this week. Ho-Jin had just come home from sorting out his visa situation and ever-so-eloquently described the experience as "a shit show". You don't learn that one at ESL school!</p><br>

<p>You can check out some photos from the hike down below, but before that, I'll throw down a few links to some cool stuff I've stumbled upon recently. Check 'em out!</p><br><br>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/MoviePosterPorn/top/" target="_blank"><strong>- Reddit Movie Poster Porn:</strong> </a> No this is not actually porn... It's a list of all the best fan-made movie posters. In my opinion, most of them are way better than the originals!<br><br>

<a href="http://www.flickchart.com/Charts.aspx?genre=Anime&perpage=100" target="_blank"><strong> - 100 Best Anime Movies of All Time:</strong></a> This is awesome. If you haven't tried watching anime movies before, I highly recommend trying a few of these out. I just watched <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em> for the first time, and felt like I was a kid again. If you're looking for something more serious, try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP2Pt6m3yKU" target="_blank"> <em>Ghost in the Shell.</em></a> Apparently it served as inspiration in the creation of <em>The Matrix.</em><br><br>

<a href="https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/reddit+top+250/" target="_blank"><strong>- Reddit's Top 250 Movies - Courtesy of iCheck Movies:</strong></a> I've been using this list for a while now and it is MONEY. I find, when browsing IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes, I tend to agree with ratings and lists maybe 65% of the time. Obviously this is very subjective, but I've found this movie list to be the best I've come across for sure.<br><br>

<a href="https://agenda.weforum.org/2015/05/what-13-successful-leaders-read-every-morning/" target="_blank"><strong>- Reading/Morning Routines of 13 Successful Leaders:</strong></a> I found this list interesting and motivating. Makes me want to do some more magazine reading. There are some interesting links within this article as well.<br><br>
