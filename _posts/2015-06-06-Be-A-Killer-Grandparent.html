<p><br>What motivates you? If you're not able to answer that question right away, a great place to start might be to live in pursuit of becoming the best grandparent you can possibly be. There are so many reasons why this mantra should lead one to live an exciting, meaningful, and fulfilling life that they can look back on fondly and proudly. Here is a short list of a few of those reasons.</p><br>

<u><h2>THE STORIES </h2></u>
<h4>(Bonus Points If They’re Well-Documented)</h4><br><br>

<p>Having some <strong>AWESOME STORIES</strong> is crucial, if you want to be a killer Grandma or Grandpa (or both? Because gender stuff! You can be a Grand-Dragon for all I care, just be an awesome Grand-Dragon!).</p><br>

<p>If you spend your life doing crazy, wonderful, interesting things, and creating beautiful stories, obviously you’re going to enjoy yourself in the process. Perhaps the best part though, even once you’re old, tired, and no longer physically able to jump off waterfalls, run from bulls, or rage at music festivals, you can hopefully relive these stories by telling them to your grandchildren at an inappropriate age.</p><br>

<p>AND, if you’ve got written, witness, photo, or – in the best possible case – video evidence of these spectacular events, your grandchildren will worship you. You’ll also have cool stuff to show off to your golf buddies in Florida.</p><br>

<p>If you need some help or inspiration with the video evidence part, check out my friend Mat Barkley and his awesome team at <strong><a href="http://www.badfunmedia.com/" target="_blank"> BADFUNMEDIA.COM.</a></strong> <br><br>


<u><h2>Motivation to not Destroy the Earth </h2></u><br><br>

<p>No matter how many incredible stories you have about the glory days, your grandchildren will have an awfully hard time enjoying those stories if they’re born into a post-apocalyptic nightmare, with no food and no more polar bears. They will be especially pissed off if they know it’s your fault, because you couldn’t be bothered to recycle, drove a Hummer, and fracked the whole planet up for everyone else.</p><br>

<p>For those who choose to turn a blind eye, or who simply don’t care about future generations, have fun listening to this!!!</p><br><br>

<u><h2>Extra Incentive to Maintain Your Integrity</u></h2><br><br>

<p>Someday, I think it’s safe to say that most of us hope to have grandchildren of our own, and hope that we’ll have given them reason to be proud of us and what we’ve done with our lives. A surefire way to screw that up would be to treat everyone around you like dirt, and develop a reputation as a classless jerk. The last thing you want is for your grandkids to grow up and find out that you were an ass.</p><br>

<p>That being said, nobody is perfect. If you’re like me, and you’ve made your share of mistakes, it might be a good idea to swallow your pride and apologize directly for them. </p><br>
