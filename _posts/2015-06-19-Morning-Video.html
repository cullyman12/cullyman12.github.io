<p><br>I am finally finished my spring courses, and I am liberated for the summer! All through exams, I kept telling myself that if I weren't studying, I'd be out doing cool stuff and making the most of my time. Now that they're over, I promised myself that I would do just that. This morning I challenged myself to film, edit, post, and blog about a video before 10:00am. Check it out!!!</p><br>

<p> Admittedly, this will be posted at about 10:30am, but I still had an awesome morning and learned a few things! I bought a tripod off Kijiji, and I've been doing some reading about getting the most out of your iPhone camera. I even found out that one of the best films at Sundance was filmed on an iPhone 5. I thought that was super cool. <br>

<p><strong>And here is a whole website dedicated to iPhone photography! - <a href="http://iphonephotographyschool.com/" target="_blank"> iPhone Photography School</a></strong></p><br>
<p>The water at Chocolate Lake was actually insanely warm (like bathwater warm). I'll definitely be going back for some more morning dips.</p><br>

<p>I'm so excited to do more biking, hiking, camping, filming, editing, reading, writing, coding and other stuffing now that school is done. Woo!</p>
