<p>Back in the summer, I made a post, titled “Motivation for Your Monday”, and it seemed to be quite well-received – which comes as no surprise. Finding the motivation to wake up early and to use our time productively can be extremely difficult. Especially for those of us who live in a place with cold, dark, and long winters, which can really take a toll on our psyche. Since this struggle is something we all face, and it can be so difficult to overcome, each Monday, I’ll be writing a Motivation Monday post to provide a little kick start to your week.</p><br>

<p>We’re all motivated by different types of stimuli, and require different forms of motivation to overcome different obstacles. The Internet is full of motivational videos, quotes, and other content, but that’s not always enough. This week, I’m going to talk about two tricks I use to keep myself moving, even when it feels near impossible to do so.</p><br>

<h4>1) The Ulysses Contract:</h4><br>

<p>This is something I’ve done for a long time, but only learned the name for it a few months ago. A Ulysses contract is a decision that you make, in order to bind your future self. The name comes from a story about Ulysses, a hero from Greek literature, in which he wanted to listen to the songs of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siren_(mythology)" target="_blank"> <strong>Sirens</strong></a>. The Sirens were beautiful, mermaid-like creatures, who sang songs that drove men mad, forcing them to crash their ships into the rocks, from which the Sirens sang.</p><br>

<p>As the story goes, Ulysses asked his men to tie him, tightly, to the ship’s mast, and had them stuff their own ears with wax. In doing this, Ulysses was able to hear the song of the legendary Sirens, and his future self was unable to escape the ropes, preventing him from crashing the ship into the rocks, which he surely would have.</p> <br>

<p>I really like that story, and I really like using Ulysses Contracts. <strong>A few examples of these would be:</strong></p><br>

<p>1) Plugging your phone/alarm in on the other side of the room, so you have to get out of bed in the morning to turn it off. Or maybe using one of those apps that requires you to answer a math problem before you can stop your alarm.</p><br>

<p>2) Asking a friend to meet you at the gym/library/office early in the morning. You may still have to move your phone across the room, but the added accountability might be just what you need.</p><br>

<p>2) Announcing your goals publicly, or maybe just to friends. Maybe this isn’t right for everyone, but I find the fear of letting people down to be a great source of motivation.</p><br>

<h4>2) Setting Finite/ S.M.A.R.T. Goals:</h4><br>

<img class="img-responsive media-center hover-cursor" src="/img/smrt.jpg" height="1000" width="600" data-action="zoom"><br><br><br>

<p>Many of you have probably heard of the acronym S.M.A.R.T., in reference to goals that are: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Based.</p><br>

<p>Rather than setting a vague goal (which isn’t necessarily bad) such as “I want to become more employable”, you can set a S.M.A.R.T. goal, perhaps more like “I’m going to sign up for, and complete three, free online courses from <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank"> <strong>Coursera</strong></a> next month”.</p> <br>


<p>I find this makes for much more productive use of your time. When I first decided to learn to code, I kept flip flopping from site to site, video to video, trying to find the right/best way to learn. This led to a whole lot of wasted time, and not a lot of actual learning.</p><br>

<p>It wasn’t until I decided to build a project website (which eventually became this one), that I started actually learning. Instead of wasting valuable time bouncing around different pages, I was coming across specific problems like “how do I embed a YouTube video on my page?” and would google them individually, and work on them until I was ready to move to the next step.</p><br>

<p>I hope that these tips can help you get a little bit more out of your week, or even that they may have just reminded you to utilize them.</p><br>

<p><strong>Here's something to try this week, instead of sleeping in or, lord help us all, watching any show from TLC:</strong></p><br>

<a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank"><h4>Duolingo - Language Learning App</h4></a><br>

<img class="img-responsive media-center hover-cursor" src="/img/duolingo2.png" height="1000" width="600" data-action="zoom"><br><br>

<p>This app is awesome. I'm looking to improve my French, and the app actually makes it quite fun with little games - a point system - and use of voice technology. You can set a goal of 10,15, or 20 minutes per day, and the app will send you notifications to remind you to practice. I've also played around with German a little bit, I just love the sound of the language.</p><br>

<p>Have an awesome week.</p>
