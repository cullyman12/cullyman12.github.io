<p><br>A few days ago, I decided that I wanted to go on a solo biking/hiking/camping run. I decided to stay relatively close to home, and chose the Bluff Wilderness Trail in Timberlea, Nova Scotia as my destination. I picked up a $15 iPhone tripod to help me capture the trip, and biked out from Halifax. I made a short video, including of some of my biking footage and a time lapse of me setting up the tent and fire as the sun sets. Check it out!  </p><br>

<p>As awesome as it is to camp with friends, camping alone was such a refreshing experience for me. All I had to listen to were my own thoughts, birds, crickets, and the small streams of water flowing beneath my feet. My original plan was to get lots of reading done, but once I was out there staring at the fire and listening to its crackle, I didn't want to do anything else.</p><br><br>

<p>For anyone who hasn't hiked the Bluff Wilderness Trail, you need to get out there! It's packed with beautiful views, perfect camping spots, and a clean, swimmable lake. I also had not been on the Rails to Trails in Timberlea for quite a long time. Since then, it has improved a lot. You can now drive along a paved bike path all the way from Timberlea to the Joseph Howe Drive entrance to the Ashburn Golf Course in Halifax. It's also quite a scenic and enjoyable ride, especially if the sun is out!</p><br>

<p>I'm looking forward to my next trip to the Bluff Wilderness Trail, and hiking a lot farther out with some comrades!<hr><br><br>
