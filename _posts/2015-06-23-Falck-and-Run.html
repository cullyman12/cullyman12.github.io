<p><br>On Monday, Ho-Jin and I took the ferry and visited my friend Ben at Falck Safety Services in Dartmouth to get some footage for an ad I'm helping with. I had planned on doing a full video blog yesterday morning, but ran into some issues, so I've just got a video of my morning run. I also have some footage from Falck. Please note, it is not an ad for Falck Safety Services, but simply something we cut up as a preliminary test. Enjoy!  </p><br>

<h2> Here is my morning run video</h2><br>

<h2>And here is what we put together from the falck footage</h2>
<h5>The very last clip, I caught on my way home, while waiting for the ferry.</h5><br>

<p>When starting this blog, I had no idea where I wanted to go with it, and I'm still not really sure. That being said, it has been a lot of fun and all the positive feedback means a lot to me. HoJin and I were asked to do an interview on CBC Radio's <em>Information Morning</em> and we spoke about how we met, and our summer plans. I think it went really well, and Ho-Jin really impressed me with his confidence during the interview. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to share the recording, but if I can, I will post it as soon as I hear back!</p><br>

<p>The day the interview aired was my blog's busiest day for web traffic, and I even received some emails from strangers, saying very nice things. Thank you!</p><br>

<p>Lots of small projects on the go right now, looking forward to making some more videos, and seriously considering supplementing/replacing some written posts, with video blogs (vlogs).</p><br>
