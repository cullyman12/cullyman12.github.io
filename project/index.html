                    <h4>What Is The Project?</h4><hr>
                    <p>These past few summers I have been very fortunate to work at some great jobs with some great people. I've learned
                    a lot and I am thankful for the opportnities I have had. That being said, I feel that I've yet to fully take advantage of
                    our beautiful Nova Scotia summer.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since my CIS athletic career ended, I've wrestled with different ideas about how to spend my time. I do know however, that I posess the capacity to be passionate, and that I have an 
                    abundance of energy. I've spent the past few months searching for the right outlet, through which to expend this energy. Given the limitations presented by winter weather and my university schedule, a few things I've tried are: reading, writing, and learning to write code (that's how I made this site) on<a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank"> Codeacademy.com </a>and other online resources.</p>

                    <p>In my seach for an energy/passion outlet, I have decided to document my summer via blog, and to publicly create and challenge myself
                    to a specific set of goals.</p><br>
                    <h4> Why Do This Via Blog?</h4><hr>
                    <p><strong>Coding:</strong> Creating my own website is a great way to work on my coding skills.</P><br>
                    <p><strong>Writing: </strong>Producing my own blog content will help me improve my writing. The fact that it's public will motivate me to maintain a standard of quality.</p><br>
                    <p><strong>Motivation: </strong>If I announce my goals online, I'll look awful silly if I give up. Won't I?</p><br>
                    <br>
                     <p><strong>Sharing: </strong>I hope that people will enjoy reading my blog and following my summer adventures. </p><br>
