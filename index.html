  <h2>Make your wardrobe 10X better for less than $100 (for men)
      <br>
      <small>Jul 26, 2015</small>
  </h2>
  <p><p>For far too long, I was under the impression that if you want to look good, you have to spend a lot of money. I paid full price for flashy, coulourful clothes that really didn't look any better than the clothes I already had. Since then, I've actually taken the time to do some reading and have improved my wardrobe a ton as a result. In this post, I'll share some of the most useful and inexpensive tricks I've learned along the way. Hopefully they can help you!</p><br>

  <p><p>I've wanted to try vlogging for a few weeks now and kept running into setbacks, but I finally got one done! I even found a travelling book, which was insanely serendipitous (I swear it wasn't a set up). Check it out!</p><br>

  <h2>First Night of Lawn Summer
      <br>
      <small>Jul 05, 2015</small>
  </h2>
  <p><p>This past Thursday, I attended the first night of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.982566371806116.1073741886.343801065682653&type=3" target="_blank"> <strong>Lawn Summer Nights Halifax</strong> </a> for 2015, and had a blast!

I was so happy to see some familiar faces, and also had the pleasure of meeting some awesome new friends. In the middle of the event, there was a moment, during which three friends of mine fell within my direct line of vision, and I thought to myself, “Those are three fantastic people”. <br><br>These three people have all inspired me, and I am sure they inspire many others – probably more than they realize. </p><br>

  <h2>Hike back to craig's camp (with video)
      <br>
      <small>Jun 26, 2015</small>
  </h2>
  <p><p><br>Wednesday night, Craig, Ho-Jin, and I hiked back to Craig's dad's camp, near Hubbards. It's way back in the woods and really isolated. The camp is solar powered - so cool - and you pump your own water, right from the lake. We had some drinks, built a fire, and had a blast. Check out the video from our trip!</p><br>

  <h2>Filming at Falck and Morning Run Video
      <br>
      <small>Jun 23, 2015</small>
  </h2>
  <p><p><br>On Monday, Ho-Jin and I took the ferry and visited my friend Ben at Falck Safety Services in Dartmouth to get some footage for an ad I'm helping with. I had planned on doing a full video blog yesterday morning, but ran into some issues, so I've just got a video of my morning run. I also have some footage from Falck. Please note, it is not an ad for Falck Safety Services, but simply something we cut up as a preliminary test. Enjoy!  </p><br>

  <h2>Single Morning Project

      <small>Jun 19, 2015</small>
  </h2>
  <p><p><br>I am finally finished my spring courses, and I am liberated for the summer! All through exams, I kept telling myself that if I weren't studying, I'd be out doing cool stuff and making the most of my time. Now that they're over, I promised myself that I would do just that. This morning I challenged myself to film, edit, post, and blog about a video before 10:00am. Check it out!!!</p><br>

  <h2>Solo Camping Trip To Bluff WIlderness Trail
      <br>
      <small>Jun 09, 2015</small>
  </h2>
  <p><p><br>A few days ago, I decided that I wanted to go on a solo biking/hiking/camping run. I decided to stay relatively close to home, and chose the Bluff Wilderness Trail in Timberlea, Nova Scotia as my destination. I picked up a $15 iPhone tripod to help me capture the trip, and biked out from Halifax. I made a short video, including of some of my biking footage and a time lapse of me setting up the tent and fire as the sun sets. Check it out!  </p><br>
