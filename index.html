  <h2>Motivation Monday
      <br>
      <small>Nov 22, 2015</small>
  </h2>
  <p><p>Back in the summer, I made a post, titled “Motivation for Your Monday”, and it seemed to be quite well-received – which comes as no surprise. Finding the motivation to wake up early and to use our time productively can be extremely difficult. Especially for those of us who live in a place with cold, dark, long winters, which can really take a toll on your psyche. Since this struggle is something we all face, and it can be so difficult to overcome, each Monday, I’ll be writing a Motivation Monday post to provide a little kick start to your week.</p><br>

  <h2>Back in Business
      <br>
      <small>Nov 20, 2015</small>
  </h2>
  <p><p>WOW!!! I’ve literally been running around the house, by myself, saying “wow” over and over because I am so stoked about the idea of starting up my blog again! I’ve got so many ideas and thoughts I want to share, and I’m sick of scribbling them all down in my notepads, where they, far too often, go to die. </p><br>

  <h2>Summer Project Wrap-Up

  </h2>
  <p><p>If you’re reading this, you probably already know that not long ago, I started a blog as a summer project. In this final post, I want to highlight some of my accomplishments this summer, and to discuss some of the many challenges, surprises and rewards that came as a result of all of this.</p><br>

  <h2>Make your wardrobe 10X better for less than $100 (for men)
      <br>
      <small>Jul 26, 2015</small>
  </h2>
  <p><p>For far too long, I was under the impression that if you want to look good, you have to spend a lot of money. I paid full price for flashy, coulourful clothes that really didn't look any better than the clothes I already had. Since then, I've actually taken the time to do some reading and have improved my wardrobe a ton as a result. In this post, I'll share some of the most useful and inexpensive tricks I've learned along the way. Hopefully they can help you!</p><br>

  <h2>My First Ever Vlog

  </h2>
  <p><p>I've wanted to try vlogging for a few weeks now and kept running into setbacks, but I finally got one done! I even found a travelling book, which was insanely serendipitous (I swear it wasn't a set up). Check it out!</p><br>

  <h2>First Night of Lawn Summer
      <br>
      <small>Jul 05, 2015</small>
  </h2>
  <p><p>This past Thursday, I attended the first night of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.982566371806116.1073741886.343801065682653&type=3" target="_blank"> <strong>Lawn Summer Nights Halifax</strong> </a> for 2015, and had a blast! Click <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.982566371806116.1073741886.343801065682653&type=3" target="_blank"> <strong>HERE</strong></a> for photos! I was so happy to see some familiar faces, and also had the pleasure of meeting some awesome new friends. In the middle of the event, there was a moment, during which three friends of mine fell within my direct line of vision, and I thought to myself, “Those are three fantastic people”. <br><br>These three people have all inspired me, and I am sure they inspire many others – probably more than they realize. </p><br>

  <h2>Hike back to craig's camp (with video)
      <br>
      <small>Jun 26, 2015</small>
  </h2>
  <p><p><br>Wednesday night, Craig, Ho-Jin, and I hiked back to Craig's dad's camp, near Hubbards. It's way back in the woods and really isolated. The camp is solar powered - so cool - and you pump your own water, right from the lake. We had some drinks, built a fire, and had a blast. Check out the video from our trip!</p><br>

  <h2>Filming at Falck and Morning Run Video
      <br>
      <small>Jun 23, 2015</small>
  </h2>
  <p><p><br>On Monday, Ho-Jin and I took the ferry and visited my friend Ben at Falck Safety Services in Dartmouth to get some footage for an ad I'm helping with. I had planned on doing a full video blog yesterday morning, but ran into some issues, so I've just got a video of my morning run. I also have some footage from Falck. Please note, it is not an ad for Falck Safety Services, but simply something we cut up as a preliminary test. Enjoy!  </p><br>
