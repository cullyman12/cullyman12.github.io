  <h2>Filming at Falck and Morning Run Video
      <br>
      <small>Jun 23, 2015</small>
  </h2>
  <p><p><br>On Monday, Ho-Jin and I took the ferry and visited my friend Ben at Falck Safety Services in Dartmouth to get some footage for an ad I'm helping with. I had planned on doing a full video blog yesterday morning, but ran into some issues, so I've just got a video of my morning run. I also have some footage from Falck. Please note, it is not an ad for Falck Safety Services, but simply something we cut up as a preliminary test. Enjoy!  </p><br>

  <h2>Single Morning Project
      <br>
      <small>Jun 19, 2015</small>
  </h2>
  <p><p><br>I am finally finished my spring courses, and I am liberated for the summer! All through exams, I kept telling myself that if I weren't studying, I'd be out doing cool stuff and making the most of my time. Now that they're over, I promised myself that I would do just that. This morning I challenged myself to film, edit, post, and blog about a video before 10:00am. Check it out!!!</p><br>

  <h2>Solo Camping Trip To Bluff WIlderness Trail
      <br>
      <small>Jun 09, 2015</small>
  </h2>
  <p><p><br>A few days ago, I decided that I wanted to go on a solo biking/hiking/camping run. I decided to stay relatively close to home, and chose the Bluff Wilderness Trail in Timberlea, Nova Scotia as my destination. I picked up a $15 iPhone tripod to help me capture the trip, and biked out from Halifax. I made a short video, including of some of my biking footage and a time lapse of me setting up the tent and fire as the sun sets. Check it out!  </p><br>

  <p><p><br>What motivates you? If you're not able to answer that question right away, a great place to start might be to live in pursuit of becoming the best grandparent you can possibly be. There are so many reasons why this mantra should lead one to live an exciting, meaningful, and fulfilling life that they can look back on fondly and proudly. Here is a short list of a few of those reasons.</p><br>

  <h2>5 Things I Wish I Knew Before Going to University 
      <br>
      <small>Jun 04, 2015</small>
  </h2>
  <p><p> I firmly believe that hindsight is a dreadful waste of time and energy. Not to mention the strain in puts on your mental health. Every second spent thinking about what we could have or should have done in the past, is better spent focusing on what is actually within our control – <strong>NOW</strong> .  That being said, there are more than a few things I wish I had known while choosing/attending my university. Here is a list of 5 of those things. </p><br><br>

  <h2>Just What I needed
      <br>
      <small>May 25, 2015</small>
  </h2>
  <p><p>It's been ten days since my last post. Between a mix of spring courses at SMU, work, and some general anxiety, I'd found myself in a bit of a rut the past few days. Having recognized that I was slipping, I tried waking up at 5am, in an attempt to get ahead and lay out my week, but found myself distracted and unable to give my full attention to any one of my competing priorities.<br><br>I know it sounds cliché, but I figured some time outside with friends might be all I needed to get myself back on track.</p><br>
