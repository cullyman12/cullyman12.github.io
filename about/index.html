<p> My name is David Culligan. I am 22 years old and I have a passion for life and for people. I grew up in the Timberlea/Tantallon
	area, just outside outside of Halifax. I played a lot of sports and lived a pretty normal young life until November of 2013, when I grew my first moustache. EVERYTHING changed....<br><br> Not really, but now I have a moustache... I like to think I'm easy to get along with and I love good food, good coffee, good beer, and great people! <br><br> I do not claim to be any sort of expert on any of the things I write about on here. That being said, I'm full of energy, I'm excited about life, and I hope to have a blast and share some of my thoughts and experiences with anyone who visits this site! </p>
