	<p> My name is David Culligan. I am 22 years old and I have a passion for life and people. I grew up in the Timberlea/Tantallon area, just outside outside of Halifax. I played a lot of sports and lived a pretty normal young life until November of 2013, when I grew my first moustache. <em>EVERYTHING</em> changed...</p><br>

	<p> Not really, but now I have a moustache... I do like to think that I'm easy to get along with, and I'm willing to try just about anything twice. <br><br> I do not claim to be any sort of expert on any of the things I write about on here. That being said, I'm full of energy, I'm excited about life, and I hope to have a blast and share some of my thoughts and experiences with anyone who visits this site! Below are a few photos I think make me look more cool than I actually am.<br><br>I strongly encourage anyone to contact me with any questions, challenges or suggestions for my blog! <strong>Thanks!</strong><br><br> <strong>Davidmculligan@gmail.com </strong>
