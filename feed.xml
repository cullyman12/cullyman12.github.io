        <title>First Blog Entry &amp; The Power of a Random Compliment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My very first blog post, featuring an introductory video and a cheesy story about the power of a small compliment. 
 &lt;strong&gt;Please watch this video before reading!!!&lt;/strong&gt;     »»     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BHxqogqMoc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ho-Jin and Dave Intros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months back, I was walking down Spring Garden Road in Halifax, when I saw someone wearing a nice pair of boots. I thought to myself, “Hm, I like those boots”, so I told him, “I like those boots”. He was a bit startled when I said it, and I asked him where he had bought them. He told me that he’d bought them in Korea. After asking a few more questions, I learned that he was from South Korea, he hadn’t yet seen the city, nor had he met any friends.  Without really thinking about it, I just asked “want a friend?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though he seemed a little surprised, Ho-Jin was happy to take my number and I asked him to text me when he wanted to meet up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then Ho-Jin and I have become great friends. He just finished up at the ECSL School on Barrington St. in Halifax, and I will now be acting as Ho-Jin’s English tutor. Had I kept the small compliment to myself, we never would have met, and both would have missed out on a great friendship and learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have something nice to say, SAY IT! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, this blog was inspired by someone a lot smarter and cooler than myself! Her name is Mel Hattie, and you can check out her work at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.melhattie.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MelHattie.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
