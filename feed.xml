        <title>Summer Project Wrap-Up</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this, you probably already know that not long ago, I started a blog as a summer project. In this final post, I want to highlight some of my accomplishments this summer, and to discuss some of the many challenges, surprises and rewards that came as a result of all of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive media-center hover-cursor&quot; src=&quot;/img/books.jpg&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months before this summer started, I was having a really rough time. My university football career had turned out to be a grueling and extremely disappointing experience as a whole, I wasn’t enjoying my studies, the anxiety of not knowing what I wanted was overwhelming, I was up to my eyeballs in student debt, and I had resorted to all sorts of stupid coping mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after months of tearing my hair out and waiting for something to change, I decided to just set a shit-ton of goals for myself, and promised myself that nothing and no one was going to stop me from doing whatever I wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As expected, plans changed, and so did parts of my summer project. That being said, I have no regrets, and I &lt;em&gt;NEVER&lt;/em&gt; could have expected for things to have turned out as well as they did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Here is a quick list of some of the things I did in these 4 months:&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;1) I learned to code and built a website and blog (month leading up to summer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Including this one, I wrote 17 Blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) I Read 13 Books and learned &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) I filmed &amp; created 10 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ2TlP_ul9bDFBFEHP1uG8g/videos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;YouTube videos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, adding up to about 45 minutes of material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) I trained distance running for the first time ever and finished a 21km run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6) I finished two summer university courses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7) I helped organize an incredible event in Lawn Summer Nights, which raised almost $40,000 for cystic fibrosis research. At the event I met an awesome dude named Jeremie Saunders, who just launched his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1674002261/sickboy-podcast&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for his podcast called “SICKBOY PODCAST”, please check it out and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1674002261/sickboy-podcast&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;MAKE A DONATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you can. It’s going to be special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) I recorded a CBC Radio interview with my friend Ho-Jin and spoke about our friendship and summer plans, the stigma surrounding Asian students in Halifax, and my blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9) I got a great job, pretty much as a direct result of my blog, and am putting my newly learned skills to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10) I went on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4APURUB-5WA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;camping trip all alone&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; (amazing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11) I hosted four Couchsurfers, two from Germany and two from Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12) I got beers with two of my favourite teachers from grade school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, though, more frequently than any other time in my life, I experienced some moments of extreme contentment and gratitude. Moments, in which I wanted for nothing, and was just so incredibly grateful to be where I was, to be with the people I was with, and to feel the way I felt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This summer I’ve had the time to read, write, teach, explore, and to think critically and introspectively. I’ve also spent a lot of time alone this summer, which is something I really never did in the past. Throughout this process, I’ve learned that being alone can be very healthy and sometimes the best answer to a lot of problems is “read more”. I’ve also learned that life is pretty much invariably difficult, and that that same difficulty is what makes those brief moments of serenity so fantastic and so worth striving for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you’re like me or 99% of other young people (or just people for that matter) and you know that you have energy, passion, and value, but you’re finding yourself confused, unfulfilled or just wanting new experiences; my advice to you is this: Set a ridiculous amount of fun, challenging, and rewarding goals, then just attack them. Set a schedule, get up early, stop doing things that you don’t want to and that are hurting you, isolate yourself if you really must, but just go make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will warn you now, DO NOT attempt this half-heartedly. I speak from experience when I say that you will only find more distress and disappointment should you seek change and set goals, only to back out at the first sign of resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a project for me and I never knew how far I would go, but for now I’ve decided that with my hectic schedule, I will not continue blogging at this time. For now, I’m enjoying spending my little time that I do have to myself, reading, writing in my personal journal, or just doing whatever else makes me happy at that time. That being said, I might someday feel inspired to revamp this blog and get back on the horse. Who knows? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could ramble on for hours about the value of putting yourself out there, or of taking the time to think, learn, grow, and get to know your self better. In lieu of doing so, I just want to thank everyone who helped me this summer, who supported me, who read my blogs, who pretended to read them and just liked my posts, who took the time to mention that they learned something from me, and of course the beautiful people who shared some of those special moments with me this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the best decision I’ve ever made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEST SUMMER OF MY LIFE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

        <title>Make your wardrobe 10X better for less than $100 (for men)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For far too long, I was under the impression that if you want to look good, you have to spend a lot of money. I paid full price for flashy, coulourful clothes that really didn&#39;t look any better than the clothes I already had. Since then, I&#39;ve actually taken the time to do some reading and have improved my wardrobe a ton as a result. In this post, I&#39;ll share some of the most useful and inexpensive tricks I&#39;ve learned along the way. Hopefully they can help you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive media-center hover-cursor&quot; src=&quot;/img/secondrun.jpg&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Fit trumps all!!! &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It cannot possibly be stressed enough that fit is the most important thing to consider when purchasing clothes. A well-fitted $5 white tee from value village looks better than a $3000 Hugo Boss suit that looks like a hand-me-down from The Rock. If it doesn&#39;t fit perfectly, and you don&#39;t think it can be tailored to fit perfectly, just don&#39;t buy it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much any suit you buy will need tailoring to fit perfectly, but it is so worth it. For suits, leave tailoring to the professionals. For something simple like a t-shirt or jeans, consider learning to tailor your own stuff at home! A few days ago, after a quick tutorial from a friend and the help a a short YouTube video, I was able to taper the legs of an old pair of jeans that I hadn&#39;t worn for over a year. Now, they&#39;re my favourite jeans. In case you were wondering, they&#39;re the jeans I&#39;m wearing in the cover photo for this post! Below is a closer shot of the cuff of the jeans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive media-center hover-cursor&quot; src=&quot;/img/cuff2.jpg&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;These jeans used to drop straight down, baggy around the ankle. After tapering them down from the knee, the cuff hugs my ankle perfectly&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the YouTube video I used to learn how to taper my pants (it&#39;s extremely simple).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;410&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/B3zMSGmieaU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tailoring can be really expensive. Having simple tapering done to one pair of jeans could cost around $20. If you have access to a sewing machine, it&#39;s worth your while to learn! In the meantime, learn to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnrndUAUe9s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; pinroll your pants.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It&#39;s not as clean as having your pants tailored, but looks way better than having your pants sag over your shoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Develop Your Own Shopping Rules &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After learning the hard way, I&#39;ve developed a set of rules for myself that I use when shopping for clothes. Here is the process I use to detemine whether I will buy a piece of clothing or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h4&gt; 1. It has to fit perfectly, or be worth tailoring &lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I find a pair of jeans that fit great everywhere but the ankle, they can be fixed up no problem. But do they meet the rest of the criteria?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h4&gt; 2. It has to be crazy cheap. Like 50%-90% off.&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I recently bought &lt;a href=&quot;http://bananarepublic.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?pid=186133013&amp;vid=1&amp;locale=en_CA&amp;kwid=1&amp;sem=false&amp;sdkw=tailored-fit-light-gray-knit-blazer-P186133&amp;sdReferer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bananarepublic.ca%2Fproducts%2Fsuits-blazers-mens-sale-C1014860.jsp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; this herringbone grey blazer from Banana Republic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for $40. Click the link and see the regular price...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h4&gt; 3. It has to be really versatile.&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything black, white, grey, or navy blue is generally quite versatile. Unless you&#39;ve got piles of cash, your focus should be building a wardrobe, not singular outfits. I got the three long sleeve tees in the cover photo for this post for $12 each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless an item meets all three of those criteria, I&#39;m not buying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Get a shirt collar extender&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 10 shirts I own, only 2 of them fit my neck. If I wore a tie with the other 8, they squeezed my neck so hard I had to sacrifice 70% of my brain&#39;s daily oxygen supply. Then I found out about collar extenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive media-center hover-cursor&quot; src=&quot;/img/collar.jpg&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;I got these ones for $15 at Moore&#39;s. You can get others online for about $3 each.&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For $15, my possible tie-shirt combination&#39;s went from &lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt; (2 shirts X 10 ties) to &lt;strong&gt;100&lt;/strong&gt; (10 shirts X 10 ties)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Add some accents. &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;(to your outfits, not your speech)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One really easy, inexpensive way to do this is to buy coloured shoelaces. I got 4 pairs for about $15 at Winners. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Moneysworth-Best-Basics-Dress-Coloured/dp/B00GTLAKZ4/ref=pd_sim_468_3?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=03V2JC2Z03AWPJ5V03ZH&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;You can buy the same ones on Amazon for $10.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; By doing this, you can turn one pair of shoes into 4 or 5 variations, instantly.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Now Let&#39;s do the math &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Herringbone Blazer = $40 &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;+&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;White, Black, &amp; Grey Long Sleeve Tee&#39;s = $36 ($12 Each)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;+&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Tapered Old Jeans = $0 if you D.I.Y. &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;+&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Collar Extender = $3 off Amazon&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;+&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Coloured Shoelaces = $10 off Amazon&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;=&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; $89 &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really want to improve your wardrobe, and avoid breaking the bank in the process, you need to take the time to read and learn. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask advice from friends either. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Reddit&#39;s male fashion advice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has been a huge help for me. Good luck!!!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My First Ever Vlog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve wanted to try vlogging for a few weeks now and kept running into setbacks, but I finally got one done! I even found a travelling book, which was insanely serendipitous (I swear it wasn&#39;t a set up). Check it out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing is first, holy s*** I underestimated how much work this takes. I had to edit about 250 individual clips, and had the genius idea to try a new editing software for the first time. I also completely ran out of space on my mac (even after deleting everything I could possibly spare), so I had to borrow an 
external hard drive before I could finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents are also going to hate me for walking along the edge of the bridge again, but I swear it&#39;s not as sketchy as it looks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;410&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xrTEwqirtHU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my very first vlog, I&#39;m pleased with the result. I definitely learned a lot in the process, and I now know not to record 400 clips... I also now know what the sound quality is like on the first gen go pro, and I know how user friendly Adobe Premiere Pro is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I also know that I need to do a better job of telling a story as I go, instead of just slapping random clips together. For example, when Nico and I went to the library I didn&#39;t really explain what we were doing. For anyone wondering, we were working on the matchup schedule for this week&#39;s Lawn Summer Nights. Week 2 spectator tickets have already sold out, so stay tuned for week 3 tickets!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure how often I will be vlogging, as it requires a totally different skill set and work load than just writing blog material. I definitely think it&#39;s a cool concept and will be making some more for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  Feedback is very much appreciated, so please send me a message on facebook or leave comments on the youtube video, if you have any thoughts or ideas for me!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

        <title>First Night of Lawn Summer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This past Thursday, I attended the first night of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.982566371806116.1073741886.343801065682653&amp;type=3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Lawn Summer Nights Halifax&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; for 2015, and had a blast! Click &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.982566371806116.1073741886.343801065682653&amp;type=3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for photos! I was so happy to see some familiar faces, and also had the pleasure of meeting some awesome new friends. In the middle of the event, there was a moment, during which three friends of mine fell within my direct line of vision, and I thought to myself, “Those are three fantastic people”. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These three people have all inspired me, and I am sure they inspire many others – probably more than they realize. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive media-center hover-cursor&quot; src=&quot;/img/thumbs.jpg&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h5&gt; My friend Stefan speaking before bowling.&lt;br&gt; Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/melhadtea/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Mel Hattie&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;. All Lawn Summer Nights photos in this post were taken by &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/melhadtea/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Mel!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of these three special people, is my close friend, Stefan Strecko. Stefan was born with cystic fibrosis, and spoke at both last year&#39;s and this year&#39;s events, about CF, and about what this event means to him and to others living with CF. Last year, I was impressed by Stefan&#39;s confidence on the mic. This year, I was blown away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stefan and I first became friends when we were about 12 years old, while playing our first year of peewee football together. I&#39;ll never forget the first time I found out about Stefan&#39;s CF, months after we had become friends. Stefan&#39;s mom had to tell my mom, because he was coming over for our first sleepover. I remember thinking to myself, &quot;why hasn&#39;t he said anything before?&quot;, and &quot;how the hell is he so strong?&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this day, I have never once heard Stefan complain about the hand he&#39;s been dealt, and he has never let it define him. Stefan was a star football player in high school, a Canada Games freestyle skier, and benches over 300 lbs. He is also one of the most infectiously positive individuals I&#39;ve ever been around. As someone who tends to feel like the whole world just might end when I have a cold, I cannot say enough about my admiration for Stefan&#39;s unfathomable toughness and perseverance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stefan, you inspire me. And I thank you for teaching me to stay positive and to persevere when faced with adversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive media-center hover-cursor&quot; src=&quot;/img/davenstef.jpg&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h5&gt; Here&#39;s a hilarious photo of Stefan and I when we were about 13&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The other two of these three people, are Mel Hattie and Emily Savage (seen in the photo below). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive media-center hover-cursor&quot; src=&quot;/img/guys.jpg&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h5&gt; Mel (left) Emily (right) &lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said before, these ladies have provided me with more inspiration than they know. Emily was responsible for bringing Lawn Summer Nights (one of the most awesome things I&#39;ve ever been involved with) to Halifax, and if I hadn&#39;t been inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/melhadtea/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Mel&#39;s blogging&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;, you wouldn&#39;t be reading this right now. Despite their insane schedules, Mel and Emily always seem to find time to help others, donning their big, beautiful smiles in the process. They also seem to always be travelling to awesome places, which tells me I need to stop making excuses for why I can&#39;t travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know gender should be irrelevant, but there&#39;s just something extra-awesome about female role models! Expect big things from these two!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive media-center hover-cursor&quot; src=&quot;/img/fam.jpg&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Brayden and I with our grandparents&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will cap this post off with a triple-whammy of inspiration. In the photo above, from left to right, you&#39;ll see my brother Brayden, My grandfather &quot;Red&quot;, my lovely grandmother Mary, and myself. This photo was taken at my grandparents&#39; cottage, while celebrating their 62nd anniversary. We&#39;re holding the gift that Brayden and I gave to them; custom labeled cider bottles, designed by Brayden, with photographs from when they were about our age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive media-center hover-cursor&quot; src=&quot;/img/mary.png&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive media-center hover-cursor&quot; src=&quot;/img/red.png&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandparents have always inspired me. Again, probably more than they know. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for my brother, I want to start by congratulating him on being accepted to McGill University! So proud of you, Dude. Sometimes it can be a tough pill to swallow, but he has always been the brain. A few years ago, after being shocked by his knowledge on random subjects, I asked him how he had come to know so much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; His response:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;You know when you used to ask me to come outside and play hockey, but I would stay inside &#39;like a loser&#39; and read books? Yeah, I was learning shit!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well said Brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive media-center hover-cursor&quot; src=&quot;/img/bruh.jpg&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;a photo of brayden and I (probably around &#39;98 or &#39;99), again at our grandparents&#39; cottage.&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brayden has taught me a lot about the importance of reading, learning, growing, and, most importantly, about being a kind person. I am no angel, and Brayden has never been shy when it comes to calling me on my bull. I thank him for holding me to such a high standard. It&#39;s been humbling to learn so much from my little brother, who is 4 years younger than me, but I am beyond grateful for all that he&#39;s taught me. Again, expect big things from this one...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to these people, and to the many others, who have inspired me and challenged me to become a better person, whether intentionally or simply by setting the right example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

        <title>Hike back to craig&#39;s camp (with video)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wednesday night, Craig, Ho-Jin, and I hiked back to Craig&#39;s dad&#39;s camp, near Hubbards. It&#39;s way back in the woods and really isolated. The camp is solar powered - so cool - and you pump your own water, right from the lake. We had some drinks, built a fire, and had a blast. Check out the video from our trip!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive media-center hover-cursor&quot; src=&quot;/img/boys.jpg&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camp was originally built by a Norwegian man, back in 1947... Imagine if someone had told him then that, in 2015, a young man from Korea would be staying there with his friends and telling stories from his time in the Korean army. Gotta love globalization!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; Here is our video from our hike, stay, and canoe trip back &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;410&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QlVLyCG2sYY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point, Ho-Jin and I were sitting by the water and he said to me, &quot;This is another thing I learned while being in Canada. Canadian&#39;s know how to enjoy life. This is even more important than me learning English.&quot;&lt;br&gt; That meant a lot to me to hear that. Not that I think all Canadian&#39;s are wisdom-filled life coaches, with perfect work/life balances, but it was amazing to witness, in real time, my friend learning something about himself and the world he lives in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a challenge to film, edit, post, and blog about videos constantly, but I&#39;m definitely getting a lot better at the filming and editing part. I&#39;m also getting a better appreciation of what goes into filmmaking. Now, when I watch movies I&#39;m finding myself paying a lot closer attention to the types of shots and lighting used. Just like anything else, having a better understanding of it amplifies the enjoyment I get from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve got to say, in regards to making these videos, it feels so good to just be creating something. I am not a filmmaker. I have no training or real skills, but there is just something so fulfilling about climbing a tree or getting down on my hands and knees to try and get the shot I want. Looking forward to getting better at this, and to sharing it with you guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I listened to a podcast recently regarding creativity, and in the interview a Dr. Jonah Lehrer said that, when asked if they are creative, 95% of the students in a kindergarten class will say yes, while 95% of High School students will say no, when asked the same question. He explained that this is a result of society&#39;s pressure on students to conform and to stay within the predetermined boundaries set for them, in order to stay safe. While watching a Casey Neistat vlog (video blog) the other day, I came across this bit by Steve Jobs, which might just inspire you to change your answer to &quot;yes&quot;, next time someone asks if you are creative or not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Here are some more photos from our trip&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

        <title>Filming at Falck and Morning Run Video</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Monday, Ho-Jin and I took the ferry and visited my friend Ben at Falck Safety Services in Dartmouth to get some footage for an ad I&#39;m helping with. I had planned on doing a full video blog yesterday morning, but ran into some issues, so I&#39;ve just got a video of my morning run. I also have some footage from Falck. Please note, it is not an ad for Falck Safety Services, but simply something we cut up as a preliminary test. Enjoy!  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Here is my morning run video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;410&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/26khFMsQ39U&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;And here is what we put together from the falck footage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The very last clip, I caught on my way home, while waiting for the ferry.&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;410&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LOcb_ThTsvs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When starting this blog, I had no idea where I wanted to go with it, and I&#39;m still not really sure. That being said, it has been a lot of fun and all the positive feedback means a lot to me. HoJin and I were asked to do an interview on CBC Radio&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Information Morning&lt;/em&gt; and we spoke about how we met, and our summer plans. I think it went really well, and Ho-Jin really impressed me with his confidence during the interview. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m allowed to share the recording, but if I can, I will post it as soon as I hear back!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day the interview aired was my blog&#39;s busiest day for web traffic, and I even received some emails from strangers, saying very nice things. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of small projects on the go right now, looking forward to making some more videos, and seriously considering supplementing/replacing some written posts, with video blogs (vlogs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Here are some more photos from Monday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive media-center hover-cursor&quot; src=&quot;/img/falck.jpg&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;

        <title>Single Morning Project</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am finally finished my spring courses, and I am liberated for the summer! All through exams, I kept telling myself that if I weren&#39;t studying, I&#39;d be out doing cool stuff and making the most of my time. Now that they&#39;re over, I promised myself that I would do just that. This morning I challenged myself to film, edit, post, and blog about a video before 10:00am. Check it out!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;410&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/grDk-n4VKQk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Admittedly, this will be posted at about 10:30am, but I still had an awesome morning and learned a few things! I bought a tripod off Kijiji, and I&#39;ve been doing some reading about getting the most out of your iPhone camera. I even found out that one of the best films at Sundance was filmed on an iPhone 5. I thought that was super cool. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to read the article, click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/28/7925023/sundance-film-festival-2015-tangerine-iphone-5s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; HERE!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And here is a whole website dedicated to iPhone photography! - &lt;a href=&quot;http://iphonephotographyschool.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; iPhone Photography School&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water at Chocolate Lake was actually insanely warm (like bathwater warm). I&#39;ll definitely be going back for some more morning dips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m so excited to do more biking, hiking, camping, filming, editing, reading, writing, coding and other stuffing now that school is done. Woo!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Motivation For Your Monday</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;With today being Monday, and with final exams for spring courses this week, I know I could use some extra motivation/inspiration. For anyone else needing a little push, here are a few links that are certain to do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive media-center hover-cursor&quot; src=&quot;/img/melville.jpg&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wanderers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; A short film by erik wernquist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This four-minute short film by Erik Wernquist, narrated by some old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Carl Sagan &lt;/a&gt; recordings, is certain to give you chills. The film features some mind-blowing CGI, depicting human expansion out into new worlds, as well as an equally mind-blowing score and some riveting quotes from Dr. Sagan, regarding human existence and our inherent craving for exploration. My favourite quote, &quot;I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote, I love to sail forbidden seas&quot;, from Herman Melville&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Moby Dick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this film does not inspire you, I&#39;m almost certain that nothing will...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;410px&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q6goNzXrmFs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;h2&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make It Count&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; A Nike ad by Casey Neistat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, my brother told me about a New York-based film director/producer named Casey Neistat. The guy is entertaining, creative, and super ambitious. He&#39;s inspired &lt;em&gt;himself&lt;/em&gt; by tattooing the phrases &quot;work harder&quot; and &quot;do more&quot; on his arms, in almost disturbingly simple fonts. Hopefully he can inspire you too! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;410px&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxfZkMm3wcg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;



&lt;h2&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dream&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; A motivational video by Mateusz M&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you&#39;re one of the 21 million people, who have already watched this video. If you are, watch it again. Maybe I&#39;m just seduced by awesome music tracks, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case. Every time I listen to this, I feel like I&#39;m ready to run through walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;410px&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-jwWYX7Jlo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Now Go do stuff!!!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

        <title>Solo Camping Trip To Bluff WIlderness Trail</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few days ago, I decided that I wanted to go on a solo biking/hiking/camping run. I decided to stay relatively close to home, and chose the Bluff Wilderness Trail in Timberlea, Nova Scotia as my destination. I picked up a $15 iPhone tripod to help me capture the trip, and biked out from Halifax. I made a short video, including of some of my biking footage and a time lapse of me setting up the tent and fire as the sun sets. Check it out!  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;400px&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4APURUB-5WA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As awesome as it is to camp with friends, camping alone was such a refreshing experience for me. All I had to listen to were my own thoughts, birds, crickets, and the small streams of water flowing beneath my feet. My original plan was to get lots of reading done, but once I was out there staring at the fire and listening to its crackle, I didn&#39;t want to do anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive media-center hover-cursor&quot; src=&quot;/img/bluff.png&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone who hasn&#39;t hiked the Bluff Wilderness Trail, you need to get out there! It&#39;s packed with beautiful views, perfect camping spots, and a clean, swimmable lake. I also had not been on the Rails to Trails in Timberlea for quite a long time. Since then, it has improved a lot. You can now drive along a paved bike path all the way from Timberlea to the Joseph Howe Drive entrance to the Ashburn Golf Course in Halifax. It&#39;s also quite a scenic and enjoyable ride, especially if the sun is out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m looking forward to my next trip to the Bluff Wilderness Trail, and hiking a lot farther out with some comrades!&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h4&gt; I&#39;ve attached a few more photos from my trip below! &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive media-center hover-cursor&quot; src=&quot;/img/bluff/bluff - 1.jpg&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;

        <title>Why Aiming To Be A Killer Grandparent Is An Awesome Life Goal</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;What motivates you? If you&#39;re not able to answer that question right away, a great place to start might be to live in pursuit of becoming the best grandparent you can possibly be. There are so many reasons why this mantra should lead one to live an exciting, meaningful, and fulfilling life that they can look back on fondly and proudly. Here is a short list of a few of those reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive media-center hover-cursor&quot; src=&quot;/img/badgrandpa.jpg&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;u&gt;&lt;h2&gt;THE STORIES &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;(Bonus Points If They’re Well-Documented)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having some &lt;strong&gt;AWESOME STORIES&lt;/strong&gt; is crucial, if you want to be a killer Grandma or Grandpa (or both? Because gender stuff! You can be a Grand-Dragon for all I care, just be an awesome Grand-Dragon!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you spend your life doing crazy, wonderful, interesting things, and creating beautiful stories, obviously you’re going to enjoy yourself in the process. Perhaps the best part though, even once you’re old, tired, and no longer physically able to jump off waterfalls, run from bulls, or rage at music festivals, you can hopefully relive these stories by telling them to your grandchildren at an inappropriate age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive media-center hover-cursor&quot; src=&quot;/img/davegrand.jpg&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AND, if you’ve got written, witness, photo, or – in the best possible case – video evidence of these spectacular events, your grandchildren will worship you. You’ll also have cool stuff to show off to your golf buddies in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need some help or inspiration with the video evidence part, check out my friend Mat Barkley and his awesome team at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.badfunmedia.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; BADFUNMEDIA.COM.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;u&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Motivation to not Destroy the Earth &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how many incredible stories you have about the glory days, your grandchildren will have an awfully hard time enjoying those stories if they’re born into a post-apocalyptic nightmare, with no food and no more polar bears. They will be especially pissed off if they know it’s your fault, because you couldn’t be bothered to recycle, drove a Hummer, and fracked the whole planet up for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who choose to turn a blind eye, or who simply don’t care about future generations, have fun listening to this!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;



&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8MZlMMvXz1A&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;u&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Extra Incentive to Maintain Your Integrity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someday, I think it’s safe to say that most of us hope to have grandchildren of our own, and hope that we’ll have given them reason to be proud of us and what we’ve done with our lives. A surefire way to screw that up would be to treat everyone around you like dirt, and develop a reputation as a classless jerk. The last thing you want is for your grandkids to grow up and find out that you were an ass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, nobody is perfect. If you’re like me, and you’ve made your share of mistakes, it might be a good idea to swallow your pride and apologize directly for them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
