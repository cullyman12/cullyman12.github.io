    <p>Several things over the past few days have been very refreshing for me; and in several different ways.</p><br>

<p>Perhaps the most refreshing moment of all - in a literal sense - was diving in for my first outdoor swim of the year. Some friends and I packed some snacks and biked down Purcell's Cove Road to a little swimming hole called Williams Lake, which I hadn't been to before. It's just past the turnoff to the Dingle (on the opposite side of Purcell's Cove Rd). The water wasn't exactly boiling, but it was definitely bearable, and it just felt nice to swim again after about 9 months out of water. </p><br><br>

<p>Upon returning from our trip I can remember, with vivid detail, staring in awe of the old trees covered with young leaves hanging over Quinpool Rd. Just as these trees had been refreshed, so had I. I was reminded of how beautiful our city is, and of how profoundly some colour, life, and vitamin D can impact my state of mind. </p><br><br>

<p>As we continued up Quinpool, we came across these adorable little girls selling lemonade for $0.25 to raise money for the IWK and the <a href="http://convio.cancer.ca/site/TR/Thirdpartyevent/IFE_NS_General_?pg=entry&fr_id=20012#.VWxwzFxVhHw" target="_blank"><strong>Trailblazer 4 Cancer fundraiser</strong></a>. Tommy put their mixology skills to the test and ordered the signature cocktail "Pink Lightning", a mix of not only regular lemonade, but pink as well. The girls informed us that after our first purchase, our second cup was free! An eerily similar business model to that of Vogue Optical's. Lawsuit pending...</p><br>

<p>We also made a quick pit stop at a good-old-fashioned yard sale, where paperback books were selling again for $0.25. Overcome by the awesome nostalgia associated with yard sales and being able to purchase awesome things for a quarter, I picked up Stephen R. Covey's

<p>And I can't forget our awesome Lawn Summer Nights Team, who participated in the <a href="http://cysticfibrosis.ca/greatstrides/" target="_blank"><strong>Carstar Great Strides Walk</strong></a> to support Cystic Fibrosis research and to spread awareness for Lawn Summer Nights. It was great for our team to have a chance to speak with some families and individuals directly impacted by Cystic Fibrosis. It helped us gain some valuable perspective and reminded us again why Lawn Summer Nights exists and the positive impact that events like this have.</p><br><br>
