    <p><br>Wednesday night, Craig, Ho-Jin, and I hiked back to Craig's dad's camp, near Hubbards. It's way back in the woods and really isolated. The camp is solar powered - so cool - and you pump your own water, right from the lake. We had some drinks, built a fire, and had a blast. Check out the video from our trip!</p><br>

<p>The camp was originally built by a Norwegian man, back in 1947... Imagine if someone had told him then that, in 2015, a young man from Korea would be staying there with his friends and telling stories from his time in the Korean army. Gotta love globalization!</p><br>

<h3> Here is our video from our hike, stay, and canoe trip back </h3><br>

<p>At one point, Ho-Jin and I were sitting by the water and he said to me, "This is another thing I learned while being in Canada. Canadian's know how to enjoy life. This is even more important than me learning English."<br> That meant a lot to me to hear that. Not that I think all Canadian's are wisdom-filled life coaches, with perfect work/life balances, but it was amazing to witness, in real time, my friend learning something about himself and the world he lives in. </p><br>


<p>It's been a challenge to film, edit, post, and blog about videos constantly, but I'm definitely getting a lot better at the filming and editing part. I'm also getting a better appreciation of what goes into filmmaking. Now, when I watch movies I'm finding myself paying a lot closer attention to the types of shots and lighting used. Just like anything else, having a better understanding of it amplifies the enjoyment I get from it.</p><br>

<p>I've got to say, in regards to making these videos, it feels so good to just be creating something. I am not a filmmaker. I have no training or real skills, but there is just something so fulfilling about climbing a tree or getting down on my hands and knees to try and get the shot I want. Looking forward to getting better at this, and to sharing it with you guys.</p><br>

<p>I listened to a podcast recently regarding creativity, and in the interview a Dr. Jonah Lehrer said that, when asked if they are creative, 95% of the students in a kindergarten class will say yes, while 95% of High School students will say no, when asked the same question. He explained that this is a result of society's pressure on students to conform and to stay within the predetermined boundaries set for them, in order to stay safe. While watching a Casey Neistat vlog (video blog) the other day, I came across this bit by Steve Jobs, which might just inspire you to change your answer to "yes", next time someone asks if you are creative or not. </p><br>
