    <p>Well, I might as well begin by admitting that <em>yes</em>, I <em>have</em> taken a selfie before. I think we all have, and it's not like they're inherently bad. If you scale a mountain by yourself and no one's there to capture the moment, selfie away! But, if you're just sitting home feeling lonely or seeking recognition, there are much healthier ways to deal with that then posting a selfie on Instragram. This post is about those things.</p><br>

<img class="img-responsive media-center hover-cursor" src="/img/selfies.jpg" height="1000" width="600" data-action="zoom"><br><br><br>

<p>I want to preface by saying that this post is not an attack on anyone. We all seek recognition and find it in different places. I also understand that our society sometimes places different pressures on girls/women than it does on men. <strong>BUT...</strong> Even if you are fortunate enough to be very attractive, is that really the only thing you want to be recognized for? And if it is, for how long can that happiness really last until you feel the need to fill that void again?</p><br>

<p>If you're seeking connection on the internet, which I obviously do, try to share something demonstrative of your value. Create something. Draw a picture, write a story, share an opinion or an idea. I promise, the satisfaction of having created something, something all of your own, will be far greater than any amount of likes can provide. And as an added bonus, just by having tried it, you've actually gotten better at something - and that lasts.</p><br>

<img class="img-responsive media-center hover-cursor" src="/img/ericthomas.jpg" height="1000" width="600" data-action="zoom"><br><br><br>

<p><strong>Now</strong>, if we're really brave, we can learn to <em>embrace</em> being alone. This doesn't mean becoming a hermit or shutting ourselves out completeley, but perhaps just staying home on a Friday night, reflecting and collecting our thoughts. As difficult as it can be to pass up a night out, when we take the time to clear our minds, we realize pretty quickly that the world isn't going to pass us by in a single night.</p><br>

<p>If you have time, I encourage you to watch the video below. It's about a man who spent 44 years in prison, and his reaction to how the world has changed. I was inspired by the way he has accepted his less-than-ideal circumstances, and the positive attitude with which he faces them. He speaks with a sense of calm that seems too profound to be ingenuine, and he uses meditation to help achieve this.  </p><br><br>

<p>Over the past few months I've dabbled with meditation and I can't say enough good things about what it's done for me. Being alone with your own thoughts can help you learn a lot about yourself, but it's actually not even necessary that you think. <a href=" https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=alan%20watts" target="_blank"> <strong>Alan Watts</strong></a> once said "A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts". <br><br>Perhaps that quote doesn't quite make sense to you.<br><br> <strong>Perhaps that's the point?</strong><br><br> Perhaps in order to understand what Mr. Watts was getting at here, you'll need to explore the concept a little bit further.   
</p><br>

<p>I speak from experience when I testify to the value of meditation and spending time alone. I used to, and still sometimes do, suffer from severe F.O.M.O. (fear of missing out), and overcoming that has been <em>extremely</em> difficult. When I say extremely, I mean it took me years of actively trying figure myself out. I tried everything from solo hikes to listening to motivational speaking, reading blog posts like this, self-help books, and journal writing.</p><br>

<p>It's difficult to say which one of these has been the most helpful in my crusade for self-discovery, and I wouldn't dare prescribe one or the other to anyone, but you certainly can't go wrong with a healthy combination of reading, meditation (in its many forms), and spending time out in nature.</p><br>


<p>If you are interested in meditation, self-exploration, or even just learning, I highly recccomend a book called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/390562.What_the_Buddha_Taught_With_Texts_from_Suttas_Dhammapada" target="_blank"> <em><strong>What The Buddha Taught</strong></em></a></em> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/122674.Walpola_Rahula" target="_blank"> <strong>Walpola Rahula</strong></a> . The book is a snapshot of the origins and purpose of Buddhism, and it's about as comprehensvive as a 192 page book can be, with its very anecdotal style. For those terrified by the idea of religion, Buddhism is thought by many to be more of a philosophy than a religion - a mechanism to deal with the the inevitable hardships dished out by life.</p><br><br>

<img class="img-responsive media-center hover-cursor" src="/img/buddha.jpg" height="1000" width="200" data-action="zoom"><br><br><br>

<p>I also posted a great 15-minute guided mediation with some cool, esoteric music at <a href="http://daveculligan.ca/jekyll/update/2015/11/20/Back-in-Business.html" target="_blank"> <strong>the bottom of this post</strong></a> for those who are interested.</p><br>

<p>If I had to guess, I would say this post may have some people feeling a little defensive. That's okay, but if you're one of these people, next time you seek connection, I challenge you to try connecting with yourself and your own feelings.<br><br> You just might be surprised at how it makes you feel. </p><br>

<p>-Dave</p><br><br>
