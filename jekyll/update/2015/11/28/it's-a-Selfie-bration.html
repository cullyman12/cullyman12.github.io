  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Firstly, thank you so much to everyone who posted one of these ridiculous selfies on my Facebook for my birthday. As many of you know, <a href=" http://daveculligan.ca/jekyll/update/2015/11/24/Death-to-Selfies.html" target="_blank"> <strong>in my last post</strong></a>, I took a jab at selfies, and offered some alternatives for those seeking connection. Then, two days later, I facetiously asked all of my Facebook friends to post a selfie on my wall for my birthday. I wanted to to show something here; and that's the massive potential - both positive and negative - of social media, something of great interest to me.</p><br>


<img class="img-responsive media-center hover-cursor" src="/img/selfiecollage.jpg" height="1000" width="650" data-action="zoom"><br><h5> This image is a collage of the responses I received after asking my facebook friends to post selfies on my wall for my birthday</h5><br><br>

<p>As I said in my last post, selfies themselves are not inherently bad, and it's the intention behind them that is important. And this holds true for all aspects of social media, and technology in general for that matter. If you haven't read <a href="http://daveculligan.ca/jekyll/update/2015/11/24/Death-to-Selfies.html" target="_blank"> <strong>my last post</strong></a>, I would encourage you to do so before finishing this one. If you don't have time, I touched on the value of introspective thinking in comparison to chasing instant gratification, in the form of likes, especially if based soley on one's appearance.</p><br>

<p>Though I recognize and take a firm stance against the potentially dangerous implications of social media, in going forward, my blog will focus, largely, on the massive positive influence that is achievable through the use social media and technology.</p><br>

<p>If it weren't for social media, my birthday would have been entirely different. I still would have spent time with great friends, but in addition to that, I was able to connect with friends from all over the country, and all over the world. And, through use of <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/?gclid=Cj0KEQiAvuWyBRDO_Yzhpv_4nvEBEiQANBdXMjZ8kGYWi6hCLobCPOszdM4duNxkixpUNJgj6fklyx0aAnN18P8HAQ" target="_blank"> <strong>Google Analytics</strong></a>, I'll be able to see all of the different countries of the world from which different people read this post.</p><br><br>

<img class="img-responsive media-center hover-cursor" src="/img/selfies3.jpg" height="1000" width="650" data-action="zoom"><br><br><br>


<p><strong>I also noticed an interesting phenomenon in action, just after launching my little selfie experiment.</strong><br><br>At the start, most of the birthday wishes came in the traditional text form, and just a few went out on a limb and posted some funny selfies. But, after a few hours went by, more and more of my friends jumped in on the action. After they'd seen some of the others put themselves out there, in a silly, perhaps even self-deprecating manner, they had no problem doing so themselves. The result, in my opinion, was awesome (as can be seen from the photos above). Seen below, is a quick Ted Talk that focuses on exactly this phenomenon. Again, I strongly encourage that you watch it.</p><br><br>

<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V74AxCqOTvg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br><br>

<p>Now, I won't be so arrogant as to call my experiment a movement, but I definitely think it demonstrates the power of social media, and its potential to promote positivity and collectivism.</p><br>

<p>I also want to mention that I'm working on a few different projects right now that I am <em>extremely</em> excited about. Without giving too much away, they involve a lot of social media, my brand new camera, and a strong emphasis on growth. Vague enough for you?</p><br>

<p>I want to thank everyone who took the time to subject themselves to my ridiculousness, and especially those brave few who first took the leap. And ESPECIALLY ESPECIALLY <a href="https://www.instagram.com/erincarroll94/" target="_blank"> <strong>Erin Carroll.</strong></a> Not a typo.</p>

<p>You are all awesome, and I am so excited to share more of this with you.</p><br>
